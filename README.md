# 01 - Simple Neural Network

We will implement a simple neural network from the scratch in python and will learn about the follwoing:

* Artificial Neurons and Weights (Synapses)
* Wide and Deep Neural Networks
* Data Normalization - Apple and Orange Problem
* Hidden Layers
* Hyper-Parameters and Network Design
* Weight Initialization
* Forward Pass and Estimation
* Gradient Descent, Back-Propagation for Weight Update and Learning

## Dependencies

1. Anaconda or Miniconda or Python
2. Numpy and Matplotlib
